// CHANNELMGR-705 If an action on the page causes a scrollbar to appear/disappear, a flex element with a max-width
// other than 100% (like 50%) will be rendered at 100% width. A browser-resize event fixes this and renders the
// element at 50%, but that is not a pleasant solution :)
// It is caused by flex-grow: 1; Normally, adding flex="nogrow" should be enough, but in some cases this is overridden
// by media-query rules like 'flex-gt-xs="66"'. For these situations we need to force flex-grow: 0

_:-ms-fullscreen, :root .flex-no-grow-ie {
  flex-grow: 0 !important;
